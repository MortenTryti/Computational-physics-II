# Computatinal physics 2

The course mainly entails using Monte-Carlo methods to simulate large complex systems, in this case a many body quantum wave-function. This was the main part of project one, trying to simulate a non-interacting system and later implimenting an interaction. Project two was mostly focused on taking what we had developed in project one, but adding machine learning
 through using an energy based generative AI (a restricted Gaussian-Binary Boltzmann machine) as our trial state-function. Hence we got to develop tools to simulate complex systems using 


 * Statistical methods like Monte-Carlo simulation
 * Machine learning through the restricted Gaussian-Binary Boltzmann machine
 * The google-developed library JAX for Python, which made calculations increadibly fast
